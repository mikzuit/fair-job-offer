As you can understand GDPR (link in the footnote) let me ask for my 
"Right to be forgotten" (data removal of email, number and resume) and specially 
follow this part below (quoted text copied from EU GDPR) and address this with 
your superiors since this could lead to legal issues for your company and You don't want to 
get involved on this, keep in mind companies usually blame workers not following
GDPR. Always have an email copy of you asking your superiors to delete candidate data.

"GDPR obliges you to collect data only for “specified, explicit and legitimate 
purposes.” This means, for example, that you can source candidate data as long as 
you collect job-related information only and you intend to contact sourced 
candidates within 30 days."

This is just a friendly reminder so you won't get involved on illegal job posting. 
Of course we can contact again for any position the same way we contact the last 
time (Social Media, your usual job posting site, etc).

Thanks
