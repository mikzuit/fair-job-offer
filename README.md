# The Fair job offer repository :+1:

This project intend to be an aid for developers, Software Engineers, DevOps :computer: mainly but since job offers work the same way this could be applied to any other careers.
This is information gather from coworkers, aquaintances and personal experience all my career on Big Corp, Big consulting firms, Small Consulting Companies and as a Freelance.

## TL:DR

Do this and you'll be more happy looking for a job ... and secure.

a. For the sake of transparency, this bellow always should be given, if not, you might be wasting your time with a fake job offer. This is legal to ask for and they should always give to you since is public info. 

### Job offer essentials:

1. Title / role 
2. Description / technical stack (check for date and browse in google)
3. Requirements / skills (browse in google for similar offers) (if they are not clear, is a sign of unprofessionalism)
4. Salary range / Benefits (They asking you for you range is a sign of they would look for a position for you, not an actual position, job poll)
5. Company info (always ask for registered company name ie. Not Microsoft but MICROSOFT CORPORATION LTD on the UK). Search for this info, for legal info with name or registed ID. (if they don't have this, is a bad sign)
6. Type of contract (B2B, C2C, are they emplyers?, are they only headhunting). Ask them to explain. (If they don't have this info is a bas sign)

b. Use my [First contact email](helpers/email-first-contact.txt) in order to save time.

c. If they contact you by phone or social medial (try not to waste your time here, talk to them AFTER you have all the essentials), always ask them to do by email, send them your requirements; [First contact email](helpers/email-first-contact.txt) (you can do this, they NEED labor, they are not making you a favor).

d. Grab my [Templates](templates) to make a easy to understand Resume and cover letters.

This ABCD would basically filter hundred fake job offers. Remember to read the reasons they could use fake job postings. It would save you a lot of time and you'll be less frustrated.

## I. Why this project was created

Any person who applies to a job position in Europe  üá©üá™ üá´üá∑ üá™üá∏ üá¨üáß üáÆüáπ are covered by the EU GDPR :lock:. In short you can say your personal data is protected :muscle: by this, but the job market does not only have an Employeer and Candidates there are also:

#### [1] Big Companies :office:
#### [2] Big Consulting Firms :office:
#### [3] Little Consulting / Contractors :briefcase:
#### [4] Recruitment Companies :briefcase:
#### [5] Head Hunters :briefcase:
#### [6] Freelancers :woman: :man:
#### [7] Candidates :woman: :man:

Let me tell you an story:

üèÅ At the beginning [1](#1-big-companies-office) hired [6](#6-freelancers-woman-man) and [7](#7-candidates-woman-man) and eveything was relatively "normal", but then [3](#3-little-consulting--contractors-briefcase) and [4](#4-recruitment-companies-briefcase) saw an opportunity in here but what are they gonna do? Charge more money to [1](#1-big-companies-office) or pay less to [6](#6-freelancers) and [7](#7-candidates). So then your salary drop a bit. Then few of those [3](#3-little-consulting--contractors-briefcase) become [2](#2-big-conculting-firms-office) and they own all the projects in [1](#1-big-companies-office) and then they hire [3](#3-little-consulting--contractors-briefcase) so your salary has to drop a little bit more. So then [3](#3-little-consulting--contractors-briefcase) and [4](#4-recruitment-companies-briefcase) starting to use [5](#5-head-hunters-briefcase)) so you know what happened with your salary?. üèÅ

**So In short:**

First: Your time is most important

Second: too many third party involved and not necessary in most cases.

Third: avoid jobs market turned into marketing strategy.

Fourth: protect personal data (in resume); which is usually process to steal passwords; and not being spread over companies.

Fifth: To share with people looking for a job all the templates (Resume, Cover Letter, Footnotes) and text to copy/paste to tighten your rights.

Sixth: Improove Quality of job market.

**A bit extended:**

First: Your time is the most valuable asset, the more recruiters you get involved with, the more time you waste usually and you will get frustrated or disapointed because they don't even call you back, of course! they are looking for a job for you, they haven't had any at first place, is important to ask question to identify the situation.

Second: If a third party company gives you toys, gifs, poor training (even not in working hours) or crashing your real job schedule this might be a bad sign, there is no need for that third party (Except for big corps, the more third party involved the cheaper the labor become, less responsabilities with third party workers and of course less legal issues with them). In some cases you can say third party is "relevant" but not usually the case.

Third: In any Marketing Strategy the most important thing is knowing your targeted customers. So in Job hunting a job mean gathering hundreds or thousands of personal info from canditates each time a job is posted. That is where GDPR :lock: comes and is just about to one question to this be BROKEN. "Can I keep your data for future position?". You should never let them keep or at least until 30 days have been past, just look for jobs you are interested in as always, use Search engines, social media, job sites, etc.

Fourth: In pentesting (penetration testing) all the things you do, words in your day to day, skills, personal info are the basics to decrypt passwords, this is call password cracking and is heavily use by attackers.

Sixth: This project does not intend to blame anyone but to make us work together to improove quality of this job market. Doctors and Lawyers can be recruited or work for third party too, but not a the level of engineering, maybe just because they are simple more interested in their rights.


## II. How this project help you

This project intends:

1. To protect applicant's personal data.
2. Avoid misuse of job offerings.
3. Avoid job market to crush due to third party contractors.
4. Make easier for companies to find applicants.
5. Make applicants aware how a job market could be disrupted.
6. Following this rules, your profile and personalitty stands out from others.

## III. How to approach/act against a fake job position, regular recruiting or headhunting

First check the [essentials](#job-offer-essentials), consider this list: 

#### [A] Job Position
#### [B] Job Description
#### [C] Salary Range
#### [D] Registed name of the company 
 `( Hello! you are going to sign a contract, you should know what your paycheck says under Employeer )`
#### [E] Something fishy is going on
#### [F] Job offering
#### [G] Email Claiming your data protection under GDPR
#### [H] Email Gdpr signature

... and keep in mind the following tips:

1. Any [A](#a-job-position) should have a [B](#b-job-description) and [C](#salary-range). You couldn't have interest whithout this, always ask for it, if they cannot tell you, then [E](#e-something-fishy-is-going-on) ‚úÖ
2. [B](#b-job-description) , [C](#c-salary-range) and [D](#d-registered-name-of-the-company) are never "Confidential" that's public information in a [F](#f-job-offering), if they cannot tell you, then [E](#e-something-fishy-is-going-on). Unless you have received an offer from NSA or similar. ‚úÖ
3. Always better to have everthing on email, it can be used legally, phone calls are convinient for them not for you. So if they call, tell politelly "Ok, but i'm going to ask you for the same info you want to give in phone by email so we can continue there and then I will not forget anything you would tell me". ‚úÖ
4. If they insist on calling you, remember, usually they are not engineers on the first call you are best suited to know if your profile suits the description. ‚úÖ
5. Always use [this footnote](footnotes/gdpr_mail_footnote.html) [H](h-email-gdpr-signature) in your email signature. ‚úÖ
6. Always search on any search engine using [script folder](scripts) for [B](#b-job-description) , [D](#d-registered-name-of-the-company) or any person of interest. ‚úÖ
7. "We have exclusive partnership" usually means nothing, could mean they didn't even had talk to each other. ‚úÖ
8. Any [A](#a-job-position) on the Internet should have a date, if not [E](#e-something-fishy-is-going-o). Always use the string search (use [script folder](scripts) ), sometimes you will find a lot of similar offers to understand how they being reused from country to another. ‚úÖ
9. Sometimes they could have a short [B](#b-job-description) it could happen, still you can ask for them to share by email anyways so you can use search engine or have it as probe of contact. ‚úÖ
10. Use [templates folder](/templates/Resume_Template.docx) Resume to create yours, this already include a GDPR footnote and shows "SKILLS" with level first, that way when looking for candidates they would easily see level and skills you have, which is usually the main reason to hire someone. ‚úÖ
11. When the process ends you always should answer in your email or social media with [G](#g-email-claiming-your-data-protection-under-gdpr) and always CONFIRM you want them to remove you data. Many of them sent emails asking for confirmation. Don't forget that some of them would write you "we will remove from our recruitment marketing database" and "our recruitment system" this would tell you how much of info of you they process already. ‚úÖ
12. Recruiters are the most important piece in this game, usually they never been told the actual reasons why they cannot give a Company Info or the real relation with a company (usually a Owner or Director just refers this info to them), they just been told "you are helping people to have a job" . Always be nice to them, always reminds them to comunicate to superiors about your data to be removed, Companies blame workers, always use an email like this [one](helpers/email-rejected.txt) y tell them to have a copy of they asking their superior, this is legally important for them. ‚úÖ
13. Always keep calm, you are dealing with people that THINK they 100% honest and they HELP people. What you asking here is not illegal, rude, neither absurd you are just following the law.
14. Get use to copy/paste [content of file](/helpers/email-rejected.txt) into your emails, Linkedin, Job Sites, Stackoverflow , etc.  ‚úÖ
15. Asking for a process ending date or when will this company planed for this position to be cover? will give and idea of the importance, procastination usually means [E](#e-something-fishy-is-going-on).  ‚úÖ
16. Always search for your job yourself, they do not have more tools than you have, They will have Memberships for linkedin, stackoverflow and others but those doesn't give special attention in a [A](#a-job-position). ‚úÖ
17. Is OK to receive emails from someone you don't know where they find you, ask politely ; if you want; to remove your data with [something like this](helpers/email-rejected.txt). ‚úÖ
18. Lastly **the most important** and I cannot give much info about them now but you should read all the legal issues [Oracle Taleo](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/taleo/) , [SAP](https://www.sap.com/products/recruiting-software.html) have regardless privacy data. Both of them are the strongest together with the new [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), able to manage most of the global corporations personal data from employees. With, if not thousands, of small companies; mostly India; belonging to them working with who knows which data... or do WE. A good thing to do is search in google `"whistleblower" "SAP"` or `"whistleblower" "oracle"` (include quotes). ‚úÖ

### Who could be in contact with you and their reasons? 

Depending on where you're data is (remember we are in social media and job sites), or with who you have been shared your resume or info.

<details>
<summary>You could be contacted by:</summary><br>
- a Freelance recruiter: they might have a real offer but usually is for job poll (a search YOU CAN DO by yourself)<br>
- a Recruit Manager: they might have a real offer but usually but they could ask you for Names and numbers, as recommendations you could give. This is used to contact to them as a potential client.<br>
- a Big Consultancy Firm Employee: Same as Freelance recruiter <br>
- a HR Employee: Usually transparent as long as they could give you the essentials, check TL:DR at the begining<br>
- Consult Firm Owner: Same as Freelance recruiter usually more transparent and honest as the two above <br>
- Project Manager: this one is usually reliable, but they have time to waste and some time they are just `browsing` and a few of them ask you for Names and numbers, as recommendations you could give.<br>
- CTO / Team Lead / Technical Chief of a team: usually you are good to go, this people cost money, they have nothing to waste <br>
* Company owners: Usually this one is a good sign, but I see them wasting their time with absurdity too, some of them, just seem to put pressure on their employees<br>
* BLOCKCHAIN companies are using job offers as a marketing strategy, since people who invest the most with them are Software engineers.
* Company Owners or StartUps who think creating a job offer would make their social connections bigger and had the "dreamed social strategy" (they would do a better job posting memes). They usually ask in social media comments and posts for emails.

</details>
So you must know what works better for each, what question you should ask. So my first advice, be seated, take notes(use spreadsheet i.e.) and read the list above and the important questions bellow.

### Additional Important Questions, but be fast

Here is are a list of questions that could be helpful depending on who is calling you (check above) with time you would be able to do this very fast:

- How long have you working with your client?
- When was the last time you recruited successfully for your client?
- How long is your company registered?
- How long you been working for this recruiting company?
- Is this an actual job or for your company/personal "labour pool/job pool"?
- When you intend this process to finish?


## IV. Are you a Recruiter, Headhunter, HR?

This project DOES NOT intend to be in any way against you, in fact you could also use to keep your personal information safe. Words from Director/Owner to employees (if you are freelance too) is where most of this information is broken, if you feel important information is kept hidden from you, that's not a good sign. You could be part of the solution, in fact "Whistleblower" are just People doing what is right, people just trying to be good people working with honesty and if you in anyway feel scared of loosing your job, don't be, legal issues can be very profitable, let's hope soon we could have here the legal stuff you all need.

#### USA Data Privacy

We hope for US Gov üá∫üá∏ improve privacy rights of citizens at EU level someday. Nontheless there is the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/) Where you can report any illegal activity related to Employment.

Difference Between U.S. and EU Data Privacy Laws 
We can‚Äôt make a fair comparison because there isn‚Äôt (yet) a U.S. equivalent to GDPR. Essentially, the EU respects privacy as a fundamental right of citizens. GDPR is a comprehensive personal data protection framework designed to safeguard those rights. It governs companies operating in EU member states as well as international entities interacting with EU residents.
