# The Fair job offer repository

This project intend to be an aid for developers, Software Engineers, DevOps mainly but since job offers work the same way this could be applied to any other careers.
As basic reasons to this project cration you should know:

## I. Why this project was created

Any person who applies to a job possition in Europe are covered by the EU GDPR. In short you can say your personal data is protected by this, but the job market does not only have a Employeer and Candidates you have:

[1]Big Companies
[2]Big Consulting Firms
[3]Little Consulting / Contractors
[4]Recruitment Companies
[5]Head Hunters
[6]Freelancers
[7]Candidates

Let me tell you an story:
At the beginning [1] hired [6] and [7] and eveything was relatively "normal", but then [3] and [4] saw an opportunity in here but what are they gonna do? Charge more money to [1] or pay less to [6] and [7]. So then your salary drop a bit. Then few of those [3] become [2] and they own all the projects in [1] and then they hire [3] so your salary has to drop a little bit more. So then [3] and [4] starting to use [5] so you know what happened with your salary?. 

But that's wasn't the only problem, in any Marketing Campaing the most important thing for a company is data from users. So in Job hunting posting a job mean gathering hundres of personal info from canditates. That's is where GDPR comes and is about to one question to this be BROKEN. "Can I keep your data for future position?"

This project does not intend to blame anyone but to make us work together to improove quality of this job market. Doctors and Lawyers can be recruited or work for third party too, but not a the level of engineering, maybe just because they are simple more interested in their rights.


## II. How this project help you

This project intends:

1. To protect applicant's personal data.
2. Avoid misuse of job offerings.
3. Avoid job market to crush due to third party contractors.
4. Make easier for companies to find applicants.
5. Make applicants aware how a job market could be disrupted.


In short with a bit of pseudocode you can say:

    `const your_personal_data = { email,phone_number,resume }`

    `const encrypted_by_gdpr your_personal_data`

but:

    `function unencrypted ( personal_data ) {
        your_personal_data = { your@email,012345678,resume.file }
    }`

    `function i_can_do_anything_with_your_data ( personal_data ) {
        ## you can't stop me now
    }`

    `class company ...
    class recruiter ...
    class you {
        function ok_unencrypt_my_data ( your_personal_data )
    }`

    `if company::unencrypted( personal_data ) {
        you::ok_unencrypt_my_data()
    }`

## III. How to approach/act against a fake job position, regular recruiting or headhunting

    Simply keep in mind the following tips:
    [a] Job Position
    [b] Job Description
    [c] Salary Range
    [e] Registed name of the company (Hello! you are going to sign a contract, you should know what your paycheck says under Employeer )
    [f] Something fishy is going on
    [g] Job offering
    [h] Email Claiming your data protection under GDPR
    [i] Email Gdpr signature

    1. Any [a] should have a [b] and [c]. You couldn't have interest whithout this , always ask for it, if they cannot tell you, then [f]
    2. [b] [c] [e] are never "Confidential" that's public information in a [g], if they cannot tell you, then [f] unless you receive and offer for NSA or similar.
    3. Always better to have everthing on email, it can be used legally , phone calls are more complicated to use. So if they call, tell politelly "Ok, but i'm going to ask you for the same info you want to give in phone by email so we can continue and I don't forget anything you would tell me.
    4. If they insist on calling you remember they not engineers usually you are best suited to know if your profile suit the description.
    5. Always use [i](footnotes/gdpr_mail_footnote.html) in your email signature.
    6. Always search in any search engine using [script folder](scripts) for [b] , [e] or any person of interest.
    7. "We have exclusive partnership" usually means nothing, even they didn't even had talk to each other.
    8. [a] on Internet should a date, if not [f].
    9. Sometimes  they could have a short [b] it could happen, still you can ask for them to share by email anyways so you can user search engine or have it
    as probe of contact.
    10. When the process end you shoudl answer in your email or social media with [h]

#### USA Data Privacy

We hope for US Gov improve privacy right of citizens at EU level someday. Nontheless there is the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/) Where you can report any illegal activity related to Employment.

Difference Between U.S. and EU Data Privacy Laws 
We can’t make a fair comparison because there isn’t (yet) a U.S. equivalent to GDPR. Essentially, the EU respects privacy as a fundamental right of citizens. GDPR is a comprehensive personal data protection framework designed to safeguard those rights. It governs companies operating in EU member states as well as international entities interacting with EU residents.
