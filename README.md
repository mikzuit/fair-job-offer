#### USA Data Privacy
Difference Between U.S. and EU Data Privacy Laws 
We can’t make a fair comparison because there isn’t (yet) a U.S. equivalent to GDPR. Essentially, the EU respects privacy as a fundamental right of citizens. GDPR is a comprehensive personal data protection framework designed to safeguard those rights. It governs companies operating in EU member states as well as international entities interacting with EU residents.
