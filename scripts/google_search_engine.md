1. To Search for a specifc position with your particular skills use something like:

    `"nodejs" "neo4j" "rabbitmq" "jira" "backend" "London" "microservices"`

2. To Discover a lie about a job position always check in your google search engine for a literal string use "" this would search for the exact string 

    `"4y experienced software engineer with neo4j, Mongo and Pm2. Microservice development loosely coupled"`

with a little practice you would understand which string to search

3. To look for person info. If he really works or owns a company or if he/she has current or past legal lawsuits; you would need this for a Recruiter and a contulting company owner. 

    In England:
        `John McKay site:thegazette.co.uk`
    In Spain: "Juan Sanchez"
        `Juan Sanchez site:boe.es`

This would search for that particular person in the specified site. Sometimes you could find a Name and lastname inverted like (use Midle name if you have one): 
        `McKay,John site:thegazette.co.uk`
